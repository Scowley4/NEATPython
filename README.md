### Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (in Python)

This is a method for training neural networks that not only adjusts the weights, 
but also adjusts the connections between nodes and number of hidden nodes in the 
network. It is essentially a genetic algorithm that includes strategies to prevent
innovations from dying off too quickly.

The paper this algorithm is based on can be found here: http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf
